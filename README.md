### Results and Processes
I extracted and transformed from the bike share data taken in August 2019 from the Citi Bike website that was given. The data was slightly modified and then imported into the data visualization thats known as Tableau. In this software data was comprised into dimensions and measures, both were complied and edited to create the visualization you will see here below. 

## Customers vs Subscribers 

Customers

The data provided has contained just a little over 2.3 million individuals dara relating to the demographic and usage of citibike. The majority were the subscribers to the citibikes service compared to the customers.

The Citibike has plenty of uses in August 2019. The times that were most popular hours used was 7 to 10 and als0 16 to 19. The times related close similar to the hours of commute to either school or work. 


### Checkout Times for Users

The graph above shows the relation between the number of citibikes being used and the amount of times they were ridden. As time goes further on, the amount of bikes ridden the longer times start to decrease, shwoing the average time spent was about 5 minutes. This shows the majority of people who uses the citbike only need it for a short period of time.

This is similar to the data showing in the checkout times for users in general, once gender is added to the variable we see similar but different. What becomes more clear is that an overwhelming amount of these rides conducted in the first hour are conducted by males as opposed to females. 



### Trips by Weekday (per hour)

A heatmap was created to illustrate the times of this data. As we found in the last two visualizations, peak riding times across the work/ school week (monday-friday) are the mornings 6am-9am. During the work week we dont see as much riding between 10am-3pm. 


### User Trips by Gender

In conclusion, we came with a final breakdown of data points from our visualzation. What's shown here are the amount of times a citibike was used on what day, what gender, divide into the subscribers and customers. The data is simple. Monday - Friday apperars to be great days fot citibike usage amongst these the peak.
